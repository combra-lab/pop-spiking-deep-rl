# DRL with Population Coded Spiking Neural Network

This package is the PyTorch implentation of the **Pop**ulation-coded **S**piking **A**ctor **N**etwork (**PopSAN**) that integrates with both on-policy (PPO) and off-policy (DDPG, TD3, SAC) DRL algorithms for learning optimal and energy-efficient continuous control.

The paper has been accepted at CoRL 2020.
